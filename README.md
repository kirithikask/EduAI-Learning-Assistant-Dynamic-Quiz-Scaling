# EduAI: Learning Assistant with Dynamic Quiz Scaling

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Students often struggle to find structured, topic-wise learning resources and adaptive guidance. Traditional learning platforms lack personalization, progress tracking, and interactive elements, making it difficult for school/college learners and self-learners to stay engaged and improve effectively.

An AI-inspired adaptive e-learning system using Java + MySQL that provides notes, resources, AI tutor guidance, adaptive quizzes, progress tracking, and gamification.

ðŸ“Œ Targeted Users

School & college students

Self-learners preparing for exams

Institutions looking for smart study platforms

ðŸ“Œ Features

Student login/registration

Topic search â†’ notes + resources

AI tutor with hints & guidance

Adaptive quiz (dynamic difficulty)

Progress tracking & personalized study plan

Gamified rewards & badges

Admin panel to manage content

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack

Frontend/UI: Java Swing / JavaFX for building interactive user
interfaces.

Backend Logic: Core Java with JDBC for handling application
logic and database connectivity.

Database: nosql-mongodb for storing subjects, topics, notes, resources,
and student progress.

PDF Handling: Apache PDFBox for extracting text from PDF
notes.

Libraries for gamification, charts, or progress visualization in
Java.

ðŸ“Œ OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation â†’ Secure student/admin data with getters & setters

Abstraction â†’ Interfaces/abstract classes for common operations (e.g., user, content, quiz)

Inheritance â†’ Base class User extended by Student and Admin

Polymorphism â†’ Method overloading (e.g., search by topic/subject) and method overriding (e.g., dashboard views)

Association â†’ Linking users with quizzes, notes, and progress records

Aggregation & Composition â†’ A Course contains multiple Topics; a Quiz contains Questions

Exception Handling â†’ Handles invalid input, login errors, and database exceptions securely
